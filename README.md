# Memory Card Game

[Project brief](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card) 

**Project goal:** use hooks, lifecycle methods and a lot of state.

## Game description 

Website displays twelve unique cards in random order, each with a picture and text. The goal is to click on every card, but only once, up to a total of 12 cards, when the game is won.

The challenge is that after each card is clicked, cards shuffle in random order, therefore challenging user's memory and attention.

A scoreboard shows the current score, and the best score that the user has achieved so far.
